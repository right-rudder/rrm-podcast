Women in Aviation International (WAI) Central Florida chapter is led by passionate advocates **Aubrey Radigan** and **Maggie Broman**, who are dedicated to increasing the number of women working in all areas of aerospace and aviation. Their chapter has rapidly grown from a handful of members to over 50 active participants, creating a vibrant community of support and mentorship.

## About WAI Central Florida

WAI is an international organization dedicated to increasing women's participation in all areas of aerospace and aviationâ€”not just pilots, but engineers, mechanics, designers, air traffic controllers, and more. Since 1994, the organization has grown to over 150 chapters worldwide, with the Central Florida chapter being one of the most active and rapidly growing.

## Leadership Team

### Aubrey Radigan

Aubrey's aviation journey began with a discovery flight that "lit a fire in her soul." Originally pursuing a master's degree as a teacher, she found her true calling in aviation. The welcoming and supportive atmosphere of WAI helped her overcome the intimidating feeling of entering what seemed like an "untouchable" industry and find her place in aerospace.

### Maggie Broman

With no family background in aviation, Maggie took a chance on a discovery flight in high school and never looked back. After earning her aviation degree and ratings, she found a home in WAI's Central Florida chapter, where she has become a leader and mentor, helping to guide the next generation of women in aviation.

## Key Initiatives and Programs
