## Brandon’s Background & Flight School Journey

- Started flying in 2013 while working as an insurance adjuster.
- Bought a Cessna 172 and turned it into a rental, which led to starting a flight school.
- Grew the school from one aircraft to 14, expanding to two locations and Part 141 certification.
- Sold his flight school in 2023 to focus on Stratus Financial and Aviation Mentors Podcast.

## Key Lessons in Scaling a Flight School

- Marketing Matters: Using Google Ads and data-driven marketing helped fill the school with students.
- Know Your Numbers: Many flight schools struggle financially because they don’t track cost per flight hour, maintenance reserves, or instructor utilization.
- Pricing Strategy: When demand exceeds supply, raise rates instead of overextending with more aircraft.
- Operational Efficiency: Implement set training schedules instead of letting students pick their own times.

## The Importance of Student Financing

- Stratus Financial helps students afford commercial pilot training by offering loans for full career programs (not just private pilot training).
- $86,000 is the average cost for a student to go from zero to CFI.
- 81% of fully funded students complete training, compared to an 85% dropout rate for those without financing.
- High Earning Potential: Airline pilots can out-earn doctors by 20-25% over their careers, with top captains making $1 million per year.

## Flight School Growth & Financial Planning

- Reserve Funds Are Key: Some flight schools operate one accident away from bankruptcy because they lack a financial buffer.
- Alternative Growth Strategies: Instead of buying more aircraft, schools can raise rates, optimize scheduling, and improve efficiency.
- Using Data to Scale: Successful flight schools track KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) like flight hours per aircraft, student attrition rates, and lead conversion metrics.

## Aero Summit & Future of Aviation Education

- Stratus Financial is launching Aero Summit (May 21-23, 2025, Las Vegas), a networking event for flight schools, CFIs, and students.
- The event will feature industry panels, aircraft demo days, and key speakers.
- More resources for students: Stratus offers free ground school access, personalized check-in emails, and birthday/achievement cards for borrowers.

## Final Takeaways

- **For Students:** If flying is your dream, don’t give up. Seek financing, choose the right flight school, and surround yourself with supportive mentors.
- **For Flight School Owners:** Run your school like a business—track finances, invest in marketing, and consider data-driven decision-making to scale sustainably.
