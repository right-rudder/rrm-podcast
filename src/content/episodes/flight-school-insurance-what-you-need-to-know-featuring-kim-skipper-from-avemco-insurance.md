### Common Risks for Flight Schools

One of the biggest risks flight schools face is aircraft damage, especially during solo flights or early-stage instruction. Other frequent issues include student pilot errors, incomplete coverage, and weak renter agreements. Kim shares real-life claims—including gear-up landings and crosswind loss-of-control incidents—to demonstrate how quickly problems can escalate without proper coverage.

### Avoiding Policy Pitfalls as You Grow

Many schools mistakenly believe a basic policy is enough. Kim explains how insurance needs evolve as a school expands its fleet, adds instructors, or opens new locations. Annual policy reviews and partnering with aviation-specific providers like Avemco can help avoid both underinsurance and unnecessary expenses.

### Coverage for Students and Renters

When a student damages an aircraft, liability depends on the school’s structure. Kim emphasizes the importance of requiring non-owned aircraft coverage from students and renters. To avoid confusion, schools should outline coverage expectations clearly—via orientations, rental agreements, and formal policies.

### How to Lower Your Premiums

Several key factors influence a flight school’s premiums:

- Safety history
- Instructor qualifications
- Fleet type and complexity
- Type of training (e.g., IFR, tailwheel, multi-engine)

Avemco rewards schools with strong safety programs, including participation in the FAA WINGS program and CFI safety training. Cost-saving strategies also include consolidating policies and selecting higher deductibles where appropriate.

### Industry Trends and Emerging Risks

With pilot training demand on the rise, claims are increasing. Kim highlights new risks like underprepared students, accelerated timelines, and heavy wear on training fleets. She urges schools to maintain aircraft proactively and manage instructor workloads to prevent fatigue-related incidents.

### What Sets Avemco Apart

Avemco underwrites its own policies and focuses exclusively on general aviation. There’s no need for a broker—flight school owners can speak directly with underwriters to customize their coverage. Avemco also supports schools with safety programs, risk management resources, and policy flexibility.
