## Tammy’s Story

Tammy spent 20 years flying in the Air Force, starting as a T-37 instructor pilot before moving on to the A-10, Predator, and Reaper. After retiring in 2018, she got into professional speaking and later created a mental performance course to help pilots sharpen their mindset.

## How to Become an Air Force Pilot

Tammy breaks down the different ways to become a military pilot, including:
The Air Force Academy, which is the best shot at a pilot slot but tough to get into
ROTC, which was her path, offering a more traditional college experience
Officer Training School (OTS) for those who already have a degree
Guard/Reserve, a lesser-known route that involves networking with squadrons for sponsorship

## How Mental Performance Training for Pilots

Tammy’s training is all about helping pilots perform at their best under pressure. A few key takeaways:
Use “What now?” to stay focused instead of dwelling on past mistakes or worrying about the future.
Expect setbacks, but don’t let them define you. Learn from them and move forward.
Small adjustments in mindset can make a huge difference in confidence and performance.

## Checkride Failures & Speaking Up

Failing a checkride is tough, but it’s not the end of the world. Instead it is a learning opportunity.
It’s important for pilots to feel comfortable speaking up in the cockpit, even if they’re the junior crew member.

## Crosscheck Training & Speaking Engagements

Tammy’s four-week online course helps pilots at any level build mental toughness. She also gives keynote talks on perseverance and mindset.
