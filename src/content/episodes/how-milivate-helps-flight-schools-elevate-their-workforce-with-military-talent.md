### Key Takeaways from the Podcast

- **The SkillBridge Program**: Milivate collaborates with the Department of Defense's SkillBridge program, which allows transitioning military members to intern at flight schools before their official separation from the military. This initiative helps flight schools evaluate potential hires while providing service members with meaningful career pathways.

- **Why Military Talent?**
  - Military personnel bring unmatched discipline, leadership, and adaptability to civilian roles.
  - Many service members already have aviation-related skills, making them ideal candidates for flight schools.
  - Incentives such as tax credits are available for hiring veterans, further benefiting flight schools.

- **How Flight Schools Benefit**:
  - Access to a consistent pipeline of qualified talent.
  - Improved retention rates due to the reliability and commitment of military personnel.
  - Positive brand association by supporting veterans' career transitions.
