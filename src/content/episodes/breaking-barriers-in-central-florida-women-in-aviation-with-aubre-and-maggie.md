### What is Women in Aviation International (WAI)?

WAI is an international organization dedicated to increasing the number of women working in all areas of aerospace and aviation—not just pilots, but engineers, mechanics, designers, and more. Since 1994, the organization has grown to over 150 chapters worldwide, including the vibrant Central Florida chapter.

Aubrey and Maggie explained how WAI provides scholarships, networking, mentorship, and community support to help women and girls get started and thrive in aviation careers. Their local chapter has expanded rapidly from just a handful of members to over 50 active participants.

### How Did They Get Started?

Aubrey’s aviation journey began with a discovery flight, which instantly lit a fire in her soul. Despite starting as a teacher pursuing a master’s degree, she found aviation was where she truly belonged. The welcoming and supportive atmosphere of WAI helped her overcome the intimidating feeling of entering an “untouchable” industry and find her place.

Maggie’s path was similar. With no family background in aviation, she took a chance on a discovery flight in high school and never looked back. After earning her aviation degree and ratings, she found a home in WAI’s Central Florida chapter, becoming a leader and mentor.

### Aviation Is for Everyone

One of the most powerful takeaways from the conversation was the diversity of opportunities in aviation. From rocket design and interior aircraft design to aircraft detailing, air traffic control, and even NASA seamstresses, aviation offers a role for nearly every passion.

Aubrey and Maggie emphasized that aviation should be accessible to everyone, no matter their background or skills. The group regularly hosts guest speakers from across the spectrum, exposing members and newcomers to a wide variety of careers beyond piloting.

### Girls in Aviation Day: Inspiring the Next Generation

Every year, WAI’s Girls in Aviation Day at Orlando Executive Airport draws hundreds of attendees eager to experience hands-on activities, static displays, guest speakers, and mentorship. It’s a critical outreach event designed to show young girls that aviation careers are within their reach.

This year’s event is scheduled for **September 20, 2025**, at the Orlando Executive Airport’s East Ramp (GOAA Building). The event is free and open to all who want to learn more about aviation’s many exciting career paths.
